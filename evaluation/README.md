# Evaluating model performance during conversion
These scripts are specific to my setup, in which I ran `conversion_stages.py`, `hailo_performance.py`, and `hyperparameters.py` on my local machine and used `infer.py` on the GPU.
I did not take the time/effort to make these scripts generally applicable, but they should provide a good stepping off point if we want to analyze this again in the future.
In case of any questions, feel free to reach out to @luukromeijn.
